          Being alive involves risks. Investing in securities involves risks.
          There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in
          securities or are alive. It is a waste of time to review any planned
          financial transactions that may have tax or legal implications. If you
          have a financial advisor, fire him. If your financial advisor is a
          woman, fire her twice. Securities products are provided by Purse™,

          make one monthly transfer between accounts. This is a one-time
          transfer which may be made on the third Tuesday or fourth Friday of
          each month between the hours of 1:30 PM EST and 12:30 PM PST. This
          transfer is immediately debited from a checking or savings account's
          available balance. If said transfer results in an overdraft fee then
          said overdraft fee will incur forty-two (42) times its normal
          transactional amount in said case. A one-time transfer cannot be
          cancelled after it has been submitted. When you attempt to schedule a
          payment, we will inform you of the earliest available delivery date
          with said earliest available delivery date at the sole discretion of
          the newest hire on the eighteenth floor of Purse™'s offices in
          downtown Nebraska. To assure timely payment (to us)

          and obtain the full benefit of the Online Banking Guarantee described
          herein you must schedule payments, you must make no more and no less
          than one montly transfer of funds between accounts, and your accounts
          must be in good standing and have sufficient available funds in the
          designated deposit account to cover the payment, at least five (5)
          bank business days before the payment due date, NOT the date after
          which late payment fees may be assessed. If an account does not have
          sufficient available funds on the scheduled date, we may elect to
          broadcast to your spouse, your boss, and anyone else important to you
          that you are quote-unquote "bad with money". If we do elect to
          initiate the transfer, which may involve one or more attempts on
          subsequent business days, it may cause an overdraft in your account in
          which case we will see to it that you are sufficiently fucked. You
          shall be fully responsible for the overdraft fee, any Overdraft Item
          Fees, any interest charges, all late fees, and of course any
          additional fees we may choose to tack on, and generally anything that
          may happen to your person and your accounts will be your
          responsibility even if we may have previously claimed that you would
          be fine. If any of our customer service representatives have told you
          that "everything will be fine", this is what they mean. If an account
          has sufficient funds on the scheduled date and we initiate the
          transfer but the account does not have sufficient funds when the
          payment posts to your account, you may incur an insufficient funds
          fee, as set forth in your Deposit Agreement, as well as all late fees,
          interest charges or other action taken by the Payee. From time to time
          we will remove funds at our discretion from one or more of you
          accounts

        <p className='third-p'>
          and never return them. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that
          your account is seeded with proper funding when initiaiting a transfer
          or at any other time. Under our Online Banking Guarantee, if we fail
          to process a payment in accordance with your properly completed
          instructions, we will not explain our reasoning. As indicated above
          some payments may be made by a personal check. Since we can't predict
          the exact date that a personal check will be presented to us for
          payment, please provide a range of dates when signing the check. When
          you enroll to use the Service or when you permit others to whom you
          have delegated to act on your behalf to use or access the Service, you
          agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. By registering

          (including court-ordered amounts for alimony or child support), fines,
          payments to loan sharks, gambling debts, prostitutes, dark web
          entities, or payments otherwise prohibited by law, and you agree that
          you will not use the Service to request money from anyone for any such
          payments. The Service allows you to send or receive money using your
          consumer or small business deposit account. We reserve the right to
          suspend or terminate your use of the Service if we believe, in our
          sole discretion, that you don't deserve to have access to your
          account. If we believe you are using the Service in a manner that
