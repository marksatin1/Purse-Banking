          Being alive involves risks. Investing in securities involves risks.
          There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in
          securities or are alive. It is a waste of time to review any planned
          financial transactions that may have tax or legal implications. If you
          have a financial advisor, fire him. If your financial advisor is a
          woman, fire her twice. Securities products are provided by Purse™,

          make one monthly transfer between accounts. This is a one-time
          transfer which may be made on the third Tuesday or fourth Friday of
          each month between the hours of 1:30 PM EST and 12:30 PM PST. This
          transfer is immediately debited from a checking or savings account's
          available balance. If said transfer results in an overdraft fee then
          said overdraft fee will incur forty-two (42) times its normal
          transactional amount in said case. A one-time transfer cannot be
          cancelled after it has been submitted. When you attempt to schedule a
          payment, we will inform you of the earliest available delivery date
          with said earliest available delivery date at the sole discretion of

          herein you must schedule payments, you must make no more and no less
          than one montly transfer of funds between accounts, and your accounts
          must be in good standing and have sufficient available funds in the
          designated deposit account to cover the payment, at least five (5)
          bank business days before the payment due date, NOT the date after
          which late payment fees may be assessed. If an account does not have
          sufficient available funds on the scheduled date, we may elect to
          broadcast to your spouse, your boss, and anyone else important to you
          that you are quote-unquote "bad with money". If we do elect to
          initiate the transfer, which may involve one or more attempts on
          subsequent business days, it may cause an overdraft in your account in
          which case we will see to it that you are sufficiently fucked. You
          shall be fully responsible for the overdraft fee, any Overdraft Item
          Fees, any interest charges, all late fees, and of course any
          additional fees we may choose to tack on, and generally anything that
          may happen to your person and your accounts will be your
          responsibility even if we may have previously claimed that you would
          be fine. If any of our customer service representatives have told you
          that "everything will be fine", this is what they mean. If an account
          has sufficient funds on the scheduled date and we initiate the
          transfer but the account does not have sufficient funds when the
          payment posts to your account, you may incur an insufficient funds
          fee, as set forth in your Deposit Agreement, as well as all late fees,
          interest charges or other action taken by the Payee. From time to time
          we will remove funds at our discretion from one or more of you

          and never return them. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that
          your account is seeded with proper funding when initiaiting a transfer
          or at any other time. Under our Online Banking Guarantee, if we fail
          to process a payment in accordance with your properly completed
          instructions, we will not explain our reasoning. As indicated above
          some payments may be made by a personal check. Since we can't predict
          the exact date that a personal check will be presented to us for
          payment, please provide a range of dates when signing the check. When
          you enroll to use the Service or when you permit others to whom you
          have delegated to act on your behalf to use or access the Service, you
          agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. By registering
          with Purse™ you have automatically delegated any and all Purse
          representatives to act on your behalf as far as your accounts are
          concerned. You represent that you have the authority to authorize
          debits and credits to the enrolled bank account. You agree that you
          will not use the Service to send money to anyone to whom you are
          obligated for tax payments, payments made pursuant to court orders
          (including court-ordered amounts for alimony or child support), fines,
          payments to loan sharks, gambling debts, prostitutes, dark web
          entities, or payments otherwise prohibited by law, and you agree that
          you will not use the Service to request money from anyone for any such
          payments. The Service allows you to send or receive money using your
          consumer or small business deposit account. We reserve the right to
          suspend or terminate your use of the Service if we believe, in our
          sole discretion, that you don't deserve to have access to your
          account. If we believe you are using the Service in a manner that

          manner for which it was not intended, or in a way that another
          customer finds harassing or inappropriate (e.g., use of memo fields to
          communicate with another customer with no intention of processing a
          Payment). You understand that use of this Service by you shall at all
          times be subject to (i) this Agreement, and (ii) your express
          authorization at the time of the transaction for us or another Network
          Bank to initiate a debit entry to your bank account. You understand
          that when you send the payment, you will have no ability to stop it.
          You may only cancel a payment if we allow you to cancel a payment. In
          most cases, when you are sending money to another user, the transfer
          will occur within ninety-six (96) hours; however, there are
          circumstances when the payment may take longer. For example, in order
          to protect you, us, Purse Pal and the other Network Banks, we may need
          additional time to verify your identity or the identity of the person
          receiving the money. During this period, and in any other circumstance
          when we need additional time to verify the transfer details, a hold
          will be placed on your account for the amount of the transfer. This
          hold may never be lifted. You understand and acknowledge this. You
          understand and acknowledge that a person to whom you are sending money
          and who is not enrolled as a User may fail to register with Purse Pal,
          or otherwise ignore the payment notification, and the transfer may not
          occur. If the person to whom you are sending money does not enroll,
          set up an email address or mobile number and accept the transfer
          within 14 minutes, the transfer will be canceled and the money will
          not be returned to you. The money may also be delayed or the transfer
          may be blocked to prevent fraud or comply with regulatory
          requirements. We will notify you by email within ninety-six (96) hours
          if we block a payment that you have initiated using the Service. We
          have no control over the actions of other Users, other Network Banks
          or other financial institutions that could delay or prevent your money
          from being delivered to you. We strive to provide you with information
          about products and services from companies who pay us to put their
          products and services in front of your face. You might find this
          interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral
          advertising help us help you form relationship-based and online
          behavioral attachments to us. Here's how it works: We gather
          information about your online activities, such as the searches you
          conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit all across the internet
          and then we use this information to deliver advertising on our Sites
          and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's
          customized to meet specific interests you may have. If you prefer that
          we do not use this information, too bad. You may opt out of online
          behavioral advertising but this will not stop us from continuing to
          send you phone, email, and diret mail messages. If you opt out,
          though, you will be put on a "naughty" list and incur our wrath in the
          form of twice as many phone, email, and direct mail messages. In
          addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use
          information collected online to provide product and service
          information in accordance with account agreements. Also, if you opt
          out of online behavioral advertising, you will still see ads when you
          log in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyPurse.
          These ads are based.
