## Background

My personal and professional education is in the arts. I've spent my life in books, at the movies, watching TV, and wandering through msueums. When I set out to build the Purse banking website I knew I wanted to create a full-bodied application that didn't just work seamlessly but encouraged users to engage with the ideas contained within it.

I drew inspiration from a variety of disparate sources: real banking apps, scam websites, newspaper circulars, 80's clothing and furniture design, streetwear, contemporary politics, and so much more. The final product falls somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle formed by movies, university lectures, and Choose Your Own Adventure novels.

The site is designed for an alien tourist - a visitor who has just touched down on Planet Earth and needs a crash course on human politics, finance, sex, religion, and art. But anyone who has dealt with banks, healthcare providers, call centers, or any other type of bureacratic agency will enjoy exploring this site. In keeping with its "Brutally Honest" moniker, the Purse website never misses a chance to tell you exactly how it's screwing you over.

## Final Thoughts

Building this site from initial concept to deployment took eight weeks. It started as a small playground to experiment with React and quickly snowballed into a manic passion project. I poured all my love for life, the internet, and art into this site, and I can say hands down that it is the best thing I've every built in my life. If you've read this far, Thank You, and I just want to say that I'm thrilled to officially share this work with you.

Thanks for reading!
